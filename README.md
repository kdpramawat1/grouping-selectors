# grouping-selectors
Give 2 elements each a unique class name. Then add rules for the styles that both elements share as well as their own unique styles. Compare the output to see what is the same and what is different for each element. Dont forget to add the class attribute in the HTML file. Add the following properties.... 
First element- black background and white text.
Second element- a yellow background
Both elements-a font size of 28px and a list of fonts containing Helvetica and Times new roman, with sans-serif as a fallback.
